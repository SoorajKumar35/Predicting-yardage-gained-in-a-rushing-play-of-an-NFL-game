# Predicting-yardage-gained-in-a-rushing-play-of-an-NFL-game

• Implemented simple to advanced machine learning models in order to discover the optimal model to predict the yardage that can be gained in a rushing play given data about the start of a play

• Transformed raw data related to the start of a rushing play into data that contains more discriminative features such as attributes of the rushing player, distance of other players relative to the rusher, the BMI of each player and so on.

• Experimented with various configurations of parameters of each machine learning model in order to rigorously test each model’s performance in predicting the likely yardage gained in a rushing play.

• Achieved a continuous ranked probability score of 0.0130 which is comparable to the top-30 participants out of ~2000 teams in the corresponding world-wide Kaggle competition (as of December 1st , 2019)
